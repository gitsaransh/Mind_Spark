# Backlog Action Items

## Immediate (Tomorrow)
- [ ] **Verify Netlify Deploy**: Check if the site is live and if the "Publish directory" setting in Netlify needs to be updated to `www`.
- [ ] **Generate Android APK**: Build the APK using the latest code structure (`www` folder) for testing on a real device.
- [ ] **Manual Testing**:
    - Test "Practice Mode" (Category Selection).
    - Verify Badge unlocking (Speed Demon, Logic Master, etc.).
    - Check the new UI elements (Badge Popup, Progress Screen).
- [ ] **AdMob Verification**: Ensure ad config is correct before the APK build.

## Future / Enhancements
- [ ] **"Share Your Spark" Feature**: Add the social share functionality (text summary of daily stats).
- [ ] **More Puzzles**: Continue expanding the puzzle database (currently at ~130, target 200+).
- [ ] **Sounds**: Verify all sound effects (success, failure, click, milestone) are pleasant.
