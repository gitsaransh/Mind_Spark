## 🔮 Next Steps (Sprint 2)
When you return, here is your checklist:

1.  **Monitor Reddit:** Check if mods approved the posts. Reply to comments.
2.  **Feature: Badges UI:** Create a "Trophy Room" screen for the earned badges.
3.  **Feature: Daily Challenge:** Make the daily challenge a *unique* hand-picked puzzle (instead of random).
4.  **Analytics:** Add Google Analytics 4 to track user drop-off.

## 🛑 "Do Not Touch" Note
**The game is LIVE.**
*   Do not make random code changes to `app.js` or `gameEngine.js` right now.
*   Let the first wave of users play without interruption.
*   Only fix *critical* bugs reported by users.

**Rest well! You've shipped a product today. 🥂**
