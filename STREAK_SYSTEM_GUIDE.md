# 🔥 MindSpark Streak System - Complete Guide

## 📊 **Two Types of Streaks**

MindSpark has **TWO different streak systems** that work together:

---

## 1️⃣ **Puzzle Streak (Current Streak Points)** 🔥

### **What It Is:**
- Number of **correct answers in a row** during gameplay
- This is your **currency** for buying hints
- Shown as 🔥 [number] during puzzles

### **How It Works:**

```
Start: 🔥 0 points

Puzzle 1: ✅ Correct → 🔥 1 point
Puzzle 2: ✅ Correct → 🔥 2 points
Puzzle 3: ✅ Correct → 🔥 3 points
Puzzle 4: ❌ Wrong   → 🔥 0 points (RESET!)
Puzzle 5: ✅ Correct → 🔥 1 point (starts over)
```

### **Key Rules:**
- ✅ **Correct answer** = +1 streak point
- ❌ **Wrong answer** = Streak resets to 0
- 💡 **Use hint** = -3 streak points (doesn't break streak)
- 🎯 **Milestones**: Every 5 correct = Confetti celebration!

### **Example Session:**
```
You: 🔥 0
Solve correctly → 🔥 1
Solve correctly → 🔥 2
Solve correctly → 🔥 3
Use hint (-3) → 🔥 0
Solve correctly → 🔥 1
Solve correctly → 🔥 2
Get wrong → 🔥 0 (reset)
```

## 2️⃣ **Day Streak (Consecutive Days)** 📅

### **What It Is:**
- Number of **consecutive days** you've played
- Encourages daily engagement
- Shown on home screen and progress screen

### **How It Works:**

```
Day 1 (Monday):    Play puzzle → 1 day streak
Day 2 (Tuesday):   Play puzzle → 2 day streak
Day 3 (Wednesday): Play puzzle → 3 day streak
Day 4 (Thursday):  SKIP (don't play) → 0 day streak (RESET!)
Day 5 (Friday):    Play puzzle → 1 day streak (starts over)
```

### **Key Rules:**
- 📅 **Play today** = Streak continues
- 📅 **Play tomorrow** = +1 day streak
- ⏭️ **Skip a day** = Streak resets to 0
- 🏆 **Longest streak** is tracked separately

### **Example Week:**
```
Monday:    Play → 1 day streak
Tuesday:   Play → 2 day streak
Wednesday: Play → 3 day streak
Thursday:  Play → 4 day streak
Friday:    SKIP → 0 day streak (broken!)
Saturday:  Play → 1 day streak (restart)
Sunday:    Play → 2 day streak
```

## 🎮 **How They Work Together**

### **Scenario 1: Building Both Streaks**
```
Day 1:
  - Solve 5 puzzles correctly
  - Puzzle streak: 🔥 5
  - Day streak: 1 day

Day 2:
  - Solve 3 correctly, 1 wrong, 2 correct
  - Puzzle streak: 🔥 2 (current)
  - Day streak: 2 days

Day 3:
  - Solve 10 puzzles correctly
  - Puzzle streak: 🔥 12 (current)
  - Day streak: 3 days
```

### **Scenario 2: Using Hints**
```
You have: 🔥 8 points

Use hint (-3) → 🔥 5 points
Solve correctly → 🔥 6 points
Use hint (-3) → 🔥 3 points
Solve correctly → 🔥 4 points
```

**Note:** Using hints **deducts points** but **doesn't reset** your streak!

### **Scenario 3: Getting Wrong Answers**
```
You have: 🔥 10 points

Get wrong answer → 🔥 0 points (RESET!)
Solve correctly → 🔥 1 point
Solve correctly → 🔥 2 points
```

**Note:** Wrong answers **reset puzzle streak** to 0!

## 💡 **Hint System Integration**

### **Hint Costs:**
- Each hint costs **3 streak points** 🔥
- Maximum **2 hints per puzzle**

### **What Happens:**

#### **Scenario A: Enough Points**
```
You have: 🔥 5 points
Click "Get Hint" → Hint appears
Points after: 🔥 2 points
```

#### **Scenario B: Not Enough Points**
```
You have: 🔥 1 point
Click "Get Hint" → Modal appears:
