## 🚨 CRITICAL: AdSense & Deployment Setup

**Reminder Date:** Before Feb 3, 2026 (End of Week 1)  
**Required For:** Week 2 AdSense integration and PWA deployment

### Questions Requiring User Answers:

#### 1. **AdSense Account Setup**
**Question:** Do you already have a Google AdSense account, or should I create one using your email?

**Options:**
- [x] I have an AdSense account (provide publisher ID: `ca-pub-4564028467824607`)
- [ ] Create new account using my email: `_______________`
- [ ] I'll set it up myself and share credentials

**Why This Matters:** Need publisher ID to integrate ads in code

---

#### 2. **Hosting Platform**
**Question:** Where should I deploy the MindSpark PWA?

**Options:**
- [ ] **GitHub Pages** (free, easy, `username.github.io/mindspark`)
- [ ] **GitHub Pages** (free, easy, `username.github.io/mindspark`)
- [x] **Netlify** (free, custom domain support, auto-deploy)
- [ ] **Your own server** (provide server details)

**Current URL:** `https://mindspark-app.netlify.app/`

**Why This Matters:** Need hosting URL for AdSense site verification

---

#### 3. **Domain Name**
**Question:** Do you have a custom domain for MindSpark?

**Options:**
- [ ] Yes, I own: `_______________.com/app/in`
- [ ] No, use free subdomain (e.g., `mindspark.netlify.app`)
- [ ] Buy domain later (start with subdomain)

**Recommendation:** Start with free subdomain, buy domain after revenue validation

**Why This Matters:** AdSense requires domain verification; custom domain looks more professional

---

#### 4. **AdSense Payment Setup**
**Question:** Who will set up the AdSense payment/bank details?

**Options:**
- [ ] I'll set up the account myself (recommended for security)
- [ ] You set it up, I'll provide bank details later
- [ ] Set up account now, I'll add payment info when revenue threshold is reached

**Recommendation:** You create account, add payment details when you reach ₹1,000 threshold (AdSense minimum payout)

**Why This Matters:** AdSense needs verified payment method to release earnings
